# Ultimate-Drawer-System
Intended to be the ultimate drawer system that is
* printable with FDM printing
* optimizable for anything you store in drawers
* compatible with Thingiverse's Customizer
* written for ease of improvement (which could use some improvement)


## The System
* Drawers and complementary shelving units are sized in units called "Us".
* If only one dimension is given, it is assumed to be the height and the width and depth are assumed to be 1U.
* A 1U drawer is 120 mm wide by 120 mm deep by 19 mm high.
* A 2U drawer is 120 mm wide by 120 mm deep by 39 mm high.
* Actual drawer width is 131 * Us wide - 10 mm
* Actual drawer depth is 130 * Us deep - 10 mm
* Actual drawer height is 20 * Us high - 1 mm
* A 2U shelf (or cabinet) is 131 mm wide by 130 deep by 50 mm high. (You can't (currently) make a 1U shelf.)
